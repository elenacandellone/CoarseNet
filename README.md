# Coarse graining in networks

## Abstract

Coarse-graining is a widespread concept in science, appearing in situations ranging from highly applied, such as in efficient simulation of Earth's climate, to highly abstract, such as in the definition of Boltzmann entropy. In complex systems, coarse graining frequently appears in concepts such as renormalization, causal emergence, critical phenomena, and community detection. Complex networks often exhibit intricate fine-grained structure and multi-scale organization, and hence the choice of an appropriate coarse-graining scheme may be quite subtle. Consequently, over the past few decades, many distinct methods for coarse-graining of networks have emerged. Herein, we study the different coarse-graining methods that have been developed for networks, examining how they work, what their essential properties are, and their major similarities and differences.
